# Question-Answering-NPC
The goal of this NLP project is to enhance player immersion by giving NPCs the ability to answer any questions given a context passage. This project is BERT-based and was trained using the SQuAD dataset and a custom NPC dataset.

# Training
The following three BERT models were used: BERT-base-uncased, DistilBERT-base-uncased, and RoBERTa-base.
